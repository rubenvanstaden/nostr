## Async pull requested events

- We want to pull a set of events in a goroutine base on the input filters.

Algorithm:

Read all messages in an infinite for-loop from the socket connection and place them on a local in-mem channel.

Add channels to Connection that stays open for the duration of the connection.
This makes sense, since we will always move events only local channel from socket. If not, there is no point to have
a conection by definitino.

## Home screen layout

Algorithm:

1. Request all profiles listed in local config.
2. Stdout profile
3. Request 3 events for each profile.
4. Stdout events

## Notes

- Every struct in CLI has to encapsulate the Connection by definition.
