## Async pull requested events

- We want to pull a set of events in a goroutine base on the input filters.

Algorithm:

Read all messages in an infinite for-loop from the socket connection and place them on a local in-mem channel.

## Home screen layout

Algorithm:

1. Request all profiles listed in local config.
2. Stdout profile
3. Request 3 events for each profile.
4. Stdout events

## Notes

- Every struct in CLI has to encapsulate the Connection by definition.
